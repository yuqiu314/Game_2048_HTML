# Game_2048_HTML
This is a simple javascript version of the 2048 game.

I am going to clean up my disk so this small poor game migrate to github.
I think I will not refactory it.

But if you want...
You can have fun with double clicking the 'index.html'.
You can find the core code in 'js/index.js'.
Have fun.
